# Brew Master 
> Home beer brewing logs and recipes. 
This repo hosts the assets used to build the Brew Master website/web application. A web application focused on offering passionate home beer brewers a platform they could utilise to log the entire process and steps taken during the brew day. 

>The Brew Master app will help homebrewers improve on their brewing process and the result of the beer batches, by having a log/diary of each recipe they will be able to defer to for future brew days.

***

### Background
The idea of this application was birthed from my boyfriend who does homebrew as a hobby. During a normal brew day, he would have a notebook logging and taking notes on the entire process of the specific recipe on the day, these would include temperatures etc. Notes would be taken for each process such as the mashing, lautering, boiling, cooling, fermenting, maturing(carbonation) and packaging steps.
When he needed to repeat the same brew, or after tasting the batch he would go back to his notebook to review notes and look at ways to improve or change some of the parameters in the brew such as temperatures for boiling and cooling and ingredient amounts. 

Hence, this is where the app idea stemmed from. And thus away with the notebook, and hello 21st-century logging or technology. He will now be able to write done his brew day notes in the application, easily return to recipes to edit and make changes, and have his recipe logs available on a database online. No fear of loss of the notebook and easy access.

The application will be available to the public in the future as a beer brewing recipe site and the ability to review the recipes.

## UX

### User stories
- As an amateur homebrewer, it is important to take a record of the entire process of brew day,
to learn from my previous mistakes and help improve my future batches.

- I often record my brew day notes or logs on a physical notebook, or sometimes the closest paper I
can find, and in some cases, I lose it and there goes my brew record, no recollection of what was done.

- As a fairly confident home brewer, I need an application to store my recipes and eventually start a microbrewery or make a profit from my homemade recipes.

- I am quite new to brewing, and I often make mistakes and need to change things in my notes, my notebook ends up looking like a child's scrapbook. Having a digital notebook will help with keeping my notes neat and easily editable.

- As a user I would like to be able to see other brewer's processes, mistakes and results to improve my brewing techniques.

- Beer brewing is quite an expensive hobby, having to view other brewers recipes saves me the need to buy brew recipes from companies.

- I'd like the ability to rate the different brew recipes I make, to know which ones to repeat.

- As a user, I can view all brew recipe logs, with information such as the date of the log.

- As a user, I can search for recipes/logs.

- As a user, I can add new brew logs to the database.

- As a user, I can edit existing recipes/logs.

- As a user, I can add new ingredients not available in the database.

- As a user, I can delete recipes.

- As a user, I can create an account.

- As a user, I can log in to my account.

- As a user, I can log out.

- As a brewer, I would like to update a recipe/log by uploading a photo of the final result of my beer at the end of the process.



### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible for users to log their brew day process and log the recipes, to have a clean look with no clutter or information overload by having a user-friendly and minimalistic design.

### Scope
For the users, I wanted to provide them with a functional platform to keep their brew records, lessen the burden of log keeping on physical notebooks and eventually serve as recipe storage. 

The scope has full CRUD functionality for logs.

* A landing page that acts as a brewing diary, showing all logs recorded by the user.
* A 'Log' page that displays the recipe and process of the beer they made.
* A 'Create log' page that allows the user to add new log into their brewing diary/database.
* An 'Edit recipe' page that allows the user to update and then saves to the database.
* A 'Create ingredient' allows the user the ability to add new ingredients as they create a new log.
* Ability to Create an account and store account in database
* Functionality to login and log out of user dashboard/profile

### Structure


### Skeleton

Initial wireframes were done on paper and pen, I'll probably at a later stage add a design made in Balsamic, it was a bit challenging to figure out how I wanted the UX to be, although my idea was to maintain a clean and minimalistic look, and easy to use. The look and feel are intentionally planned for mobile and desktop.

### Database Schema

- [MongoDB database scheme]

### Surface
My idea for the design is to have colour relating to beer such as brown, gold, or essentially brown theme colour palette, this will help users associate with the act of beer brewing.

## Testing

#### Code Validation

#### User Story Testing

Read the full user story testing 

#### Chrome Developer Tools
Constantly used to ensure the app is mobile-first, and works well with all kinds of devices and provide real-time ability to identify errors in my HTML code, and helped me troubleshoot my HTML/CSS.

#### Random User Testing
Sending the app to friends & colleges to use, collecting their feedback for bug fixes and adjustments.

#### Python Testing
PEP8online

#### MongoDB Testing

#### SQLite Testing
Two ways to test that when a user signed up they were stored in the database or it worked;
  - Used a sqlite database viewer to look at the row that was added to the table
  - I also tried signing up with the same email address again, and when I got an error, I knew the first email was saved properly, also it           redirected me ssuccessfuly to the login page.

#### Known Bugs


#### Expected Behavior
* Burger menu in mobile view immediately displays nav menu without clicking the burger.(FIXED)

* Logo Image and favicon image will not load.

> Home beer brewing logs and recipes. 
This repo hosts the assets used to build the Brew Master website / web application. A web application focused on offering passionate home beer brewers a platform they could utilise to log the entire process and steps taken during brew day. 

>The Brew Master app will help home brewers improve on their brewing process and end result of the beer batches, by having a log/diary of each recipe they will be able to defer to for future brew days.

### Background
The idea of this application was birthed from my boyfriend who does homebrewing as a hobby. During a normal brew day he would have a notebook logging and taking notes on the entire process of the specific recipe on the day, these would include temperatures etc. Notes would be taken for each process such as the mashing, lautering, boiling, cooling, fermentating, maturing(carbonation) and packaging steps.
When he needed to repeat the same brew, or after tasting the batch he would go back to his notebook to review notes and look at ways to improve or change some of the parameters in the brew such as temperatures for boiling and cooling and ingredient amounts. 

Hence, this is where the app idea stemed from. And thus away with the notebook, and hello 21st century logging or technology. He will now be able to write done his brew day notes in the application, easily return to recipes to edit and make changes, and have his recipe logs available on a database online. No fear for loss of the notebook and easy access.

The application will be available to the public in the future as a beer brewing recipe site and ability to review the recipes.

## UX

### User stories
- As an amateur home brewer, it is important to take record of the entire process of brew day,
inorder to learn from my previous mistakes and help improve my future batches.

- I often record my brew day notes or logs on a physical notebook, or sometimes the closest paper I
can find, and in some cases I lose it and there goes my brew record, no recollection of what was done.

- As a faily confident home brewer, I need an application to store my recipes and eventually start a microbrewery or make a profit from my home made recipes.

- I am quite new to brewing, and I often make mistakes and need to change things in my notes, my notebook ends up looking like a childs scrapbook. Having digital notebook will help with keeping my notes neat and easily editable.

- As a user I would like to be able to see other brewer's processes, mistakes and results to improve my own brewing techniques.

- Beer brewing is quite an expensive hobby, having to view other brewers recipes saves me the need buy brew recipes from companies.

- I'd like the ability to rate the different brew recipes I make, inorder to know which ones to repeat.

### Strategy
My goal in the design was to make it as easy as possible for users to log their brew day process and log the  recipes, to have a clean look with no clutter or information over load by having a user-friendly and 
minimalistic design.

### Scope
For the users I wanted to provide them with a functional platform to keep their brew records, lessen the burden of log keeping on physical notebooks and eventually serve as a recipe storage.
